    <h1>ONLINE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
    <p>This project is a mock system intended for librarians.<br>
    <br>It acts as a catalog system.<br><br>
    The objectives are to check in and check out books, update the number of books in the library and the number of books owned by the library.</p><br>

    <li>20 + commits in the project with well detailed commit messages.</li>
    <li>The project contains a single HTML file.</li>
    <li>This project incorporates at least 3 separate event listeners.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DOMContentLoaded</strong> : in javascript to load the script</li>
            <li><strong>Click</strong> : in javascript for all the buttons in the project</li>
            <li><strong>Change</strong> : in javascript for the input (search bar) and selection menu</li>
            <li><strong>Hover</strong> : in css file for the list items</li>
            <li><strong>Focus</strong> : in css for the input (search bar)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Well designed landing page that shows a list of books (when connected to the server), a search bar, and a selection menu of the categories available in the library.</li>
    <li>Follows good coding practices by keeping code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
    </ul>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just
        for display purposes.(ap1)
        The history of the book starts with the development of writing, and various other inventions
        such as paper and printing, and continues through to the modern-day business of book
        printing.(ap2).<br><br>
        And throughout this time, people have developed ways of storing, sorting and classifying
        books. Library classification system groups books together.<br><br></p>
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
        A librarian may use a catalog to keep track of the books and classifications.
        <br><br>
        It may take a lot of time and energy finding a book in a hardcopy catalog of books
        that the library owns. The librarian has to cross check that data with the data kept after
        borrowing for each book that has been checked out and fill the necessary information.<br><br>
        This monotonous activity can lead to boredom and strain on the body for sitting for too long.
        </p><br>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>Single page web-application that does the crucial task of updating a library catalog</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>API</h3>
        <p>The API used in this project : lib.json file hosted on a json-server.</p><br><br>
